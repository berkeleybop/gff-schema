(dataclasses) SQL DDL (soon) And also online documentation: https://berkeleybop.github.io/gff-schema/ Why Currently the GFF3 spec and proposed extensions or supplementary specs are specified as text. Text is non-computable which means additional work in implementing validators potential ambiguities in interpretation additional work to create anciliary artefacts - e.g. a SQL schema or a JSON schema Additionally, GFF3 is a TSV-based format which limits ability to use standard off the shelf validation approaches - e.g. OWL or ShEx validation for RDF, or JSON-Schema for JSON Approach This project is neutral on the question of TSV serialization vs JSON serialization vs RDF vs XML ... It takes the view that datamodel and serialization are separate concerns We first define a UML-like abstract data model. We can then have as many serializations as we like JSON TSV The specification of how to map the data model to the TSV becomes a separate (simpler) problem, distinct from specifying the data model itself. It could be argued this is overkill. GFF3 is designed to be simple, it's tight coupling to a TSV representation is arguably a feature, forcing a simplicity.
